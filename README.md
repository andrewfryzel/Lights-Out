# Lights-Out
A Java implementation of the classic "Lights Out" game. The objective is to turn all the "lights" off.
"A light is either on or off. When you click on a light, the on/off state of that light—as well as 
the lights above, below, to the left, and to the right of it—toggle. 
The goal of the puzzle is to turn all of the lights off. Dark is off, light is on."
